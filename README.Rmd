## Final Summary

### Relationships Between Response & Predictors

I discovered that the most important predictor is the recipe category in predicting "High" traffic.. Both the EDA and modeling process validate this claim. There seems to be a mild relationship between the missing values in the data and "High" traffic recipes.

### Evaluating Models

"They want us to predict which recipes will be popular 80% of the time and minimize the chance of showing unpopular recipes."

- Both models can achieve a precision of 80.42% on never before seen data.
- On never before seen data, 28 out of 96 (or 29.17%) "Not-High" traffic recipes were incorrectly classified as "High" traffic recipes.
- The baseline model (glmnet) was the best performing model in terms of PR AUC and ROC AUC.

In order to improve accuracy we can explore more features. The "Example Recipe" from the instructions document included features such as:

- **Title:**: "Tomato Soup"
- **Time to make:** "2 hours"
- **Cost per serving**
- **ingredients:** "Tomatoes, Onion, Carrot, Vegetable Stock" 
- **Method:** "1.	Cut the tomatoes into quartersâ€¦"

These may add predictive value to our model.

### Connecting Model to Business Value

I used Gain & Lift charts to connect the best performing model to business goals. When sorted by highest probability of "High" traffic recipes, the first 25% of our recipes is estimated to gain close to 40% of the "High" traffic recipes, a 15% improvement over the baseline of 25%, which translates to close to a 1.6X Lift.

### Recommendations

I recommend:
- Iteratively improving the model over time with:
  - additional features
  - additional observations
  - screening more models and preprocessing techniques
- Utilize the current model as it's shown to meet targets and provide business value, time to put the model into production.

## Data Validation

```{r}
rct_tbl <- rct_raw_tbl %>% 
    mutate(recipe = factor(recipe),
           high_traffic = ifelse(is.na(high_traffic), "Not-High", high_traffic) %>% as_factor(),
           servings = servings %>% str_remove_all("\\s+as\\s+a\\s+snack$") %>% as.integer,
           category = factor(category))

rct_tbl %>% glimpse()
```

### recipe

The column **recipe** is of class *character* by default and contains unique indentifiers for each recipe ranging from recipe "001" to recipe "947". There are 947 unique values and zero missing values. As the values have no numeric meaning, i.e. recipe "947" is not greater than recipe "001", I converted to class *factor* instead of *numeric*.

### calories

The column **calories** is of class *double* by default and has 52 missing values. The minimum value is 0.14 and the maximum value is 3633.16. The median is 288.55, whereas the mean is 435.94, indicating a right skewed distribution. The column is the appropriate class so no class conversion is needed.

### carbohydrate

The column **carbohydrate** is of class *double* by default and has 52 missing values. The minimum value is 0.03 and the maximum value is 530.42. The median is 21.48, whereas the mean is 35.07, indicating a right skewed distribution. The column is the appropriate class so no class conversion is needed.

### sugar

The column **sugar** is of class *double* by default and has 52 missing values. The minimum value is 0.01 and the maximum value is 148.75. The median is 4.55, whereas the mean is 9.04, indicating a right skewed distribution. The column is the appropriate class so no class conversion is needed.

### protein

The column **protein** is of class *double* by default and has 52 missing values. The minimum value is 0 and the maximum value is 363.36. The median is 10.8, whereas the mean is 24.15, indicating a right skewed distribution. The column is the appropriate class so no class conversion is needed.

### category

The column **category** is of class *character* and contains eleven unique values and zero missing values by default. The instructions note there should be only 10 unique values. The additional unique value stems from "Chicken Breast". As "Chicken" is one of the possible unique values I simply removed the "Breast" from "Chicken Breast" using `stringr::str_remove_all()` and the following regex: `"\\s+Breast$"`

- `"\\s+"`: matches one or more whitespace.
- `"Breast"`: simply matches "Breast".
- `"$"`: matches the end of the string.

The column has a fixed and known set of possible values so I also converted to *factor*.

### servings

The column **servings** is of class *character* and contains six unique values and zero missing values by default. The instructions note that servings should be of class *numeric*. Some of the values are appended with "as a snack". I removed "as a snack" using `stringr::str_remove_all()` and the following regex: `"\\s+as\\s+a\\s+snack$"`

- `"\\s+"`: matches one or more whitespace.
- `"$"`: matches the end of the string.

`stringr::str_sub()` could also be used.

The column has a discrete set of numeric values so I converted to type *integer*.


### high_traffic

The column **high_traffic** is of class *character* and contains two unique values which includes 373 missing values. I will encode the missing values as "Not-High". The column has a fixed and known set of possible values so I also converted to *factor*.

## Data Visulaization

### Response Visualization

```{r}
rct_tbl %>% 
	ggplot(aes(high_traffic)) +
	geom_bar(fill = "steelblue") +
	geom_label(stat = "count", aes(label = after_stat(count)), size = 5) +
	theme_bw() +
	labs(title = "Count of High and Not-High",  
         x = "", 
         y = "Count")
```

The category with the most number of observations is "High" owners with 574 observations. The number of "Not-High" is 373. This means the categories are a little imbalanced. 

```{r}
binom_stats <- function(x, response_value, ...) {
	x <- x$high_traffic[!is.na(x$high_traffic)]
    res <- prop.test(x = sum(x == response_value), n = length(x), ...)
  tibble(Proportion  = unname(res$estimate), 
             Lower = res$conf.int[1],
             Upper = res$conf.int[2])
}

high_traffic_tbl <- binom_stats(rct_tbl, "High") %>% 
	add_column(Traffic = "High", .before = 1) %>% 
	bind_rows(
    	binom_stats(rct_tbl, "Not-High") %>% 
        add_column(Traffic = "Not-High", .before = 1)
    ) %>% 
	mutate(text_label = str_glue("Proportion: {scales::percent(Proportion, accuracy = 0.01)}
Upper: {scales::percent(Upper, accuracy = 0.01)}
Lower: {scales::percent(Lower, accuracy = 0.01)}"))

high_traffic_tbl %>% 
	ggplot(aes(Traffic, Proportion)) +
	geom_point(size = 2) +
	geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = Lower, ymax = Upper), width = 0.1) +
	geom_label_repel(aes(label = text_label), point.padding = 25, size = 4) +
	scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
	expand_limits(y = c(0, 1)) +
	theme_bw() +
	labs(title = "Proportion of High and Not-High Traffic with 95% Confidence Interval",
         x = "")
```

When it comes to predicting whether traffic is "High" vs "Not-High" we would be right around 63.73% of the time if we predicted "High" for every recipe. I've included a 95% confidence interval for the proportion plot to help the reader understand how much the proportion should be trusted.

### Response Vs Numeric Predictors

```{r}
rct_tbl %>% 
	select(high_traffic, where(is.numeric), -servings) %>% 
	pivot_longer(-high_traffic) %>% 
	ggplot(aes(value, fill = high_traffic)) + 
	geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +
	scale_fill_manual(values = c("High" = "steelblue", "Not-High" = "red")) +
	facet_wrap(~ name, ncol = 1, scales = "free") +
	theme_bw() +
	labs(title = "Distribution of Numeric Values Partitioned by Traffic",
         x = "Value", y = "Density", fill = "High Traffic")
```

As we can see from the plot above the distributions of all the numeric values have very similar shapes when partitioned by traffic. There is a single mode at lower end of each value and the data is highly right skewed for each numeric column. The modes are not as high in some of the columns for "Not-High" but this can be accounted for by the lower frequency of the "Not-High" category. This indicates that the numeric columns should add little value when predicting traffic.

### Response Vs Categorical & Discrete Predictors

```{r}
high_prop <- mean(rct_tbl$high_traffic == "High")

category_tbl <- rct_tbl %>% 
	select(high_traffic, category) %>% 
	nest_by(category) %>% 
	mutate(stats = list(binom_stats(data, "High"))) %>% 
	select(-data) %>% 
	unnest(stats) %>%
	ungroup() %>% 
	add_column(name = "category", .before = 1) %>% 
	rename(value = category) %>% 
	arrange(Proportion) %>% 
	mutate(value = factor(value))

servings_tbl <- rct_tbl %>% 
	select(high_traffic, servings) %>% 
	nest_by(servings) %>% 
	mutate(stats = list(binom_stats(data, "High"))) %>% 
	select(-data) %>% 
	unnest(stats) %>%
	ungroup() %>% 
	add_column(name = "servings", .before = 1) %>% 
	rename(value = servings) %>% 
	mutate(value = factor(value))

bind_rows(category_tbl, servings_tbl) %>% 
	mutate(value = fct_reorder(value, Proportion)) %>%
	ggplot(aes(value, Proportion)) +
	geom_point(size = 2) +
	geom_hline(aes(yintercept = high_prop), linetype = 2, color = "red") +
	geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = Lower, ymax = Upper), width = 0.1) +
	scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
	expand_limits(y = c(0, 1)) +
    facet_wrap(~ name, scales = "free", ncol = 1) +
	theme_bw() +
	theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
	labs(title = "Proportion of High Traffic Across Category with 95% Confidence Interval",
         x = "")
```

The plot above shows for each category and each serving size, the proportion of "High" vs "Not-High" traffic and a 95% confidence interval to help understand what the noise is around the value. I've also included, using a red dashed line, the baseline proportion of "High" traffic for the whole dataset. 

From the category column, we can now see that:

- Beverages, Breakfast and Chicken recipes have a lower than baseline proportion of "High" traffic, with Beverages having a very low proportion of "High" traffic.
- Dessert and Lunch/Snacks are close to the baseline of "High" traffic.
- One Dish Meal, Meat, Pork, Potato and Vegetables are above the baseline of "High" traffic, with Pork, Potato and Vegetable being close to 100% Proportion.

This indicates that recipe category will be very useful in predicting traffic. 

From the servings column, we can see that there is overlap with all the serving sizes' 95% confidence interval and the baseline proportion of "High" traffic. This indicates that serving size will not be a very useful in predicting traffic.

### Response vs Missing Values

```{r}
vis_miss(rct_tbl %>% arrange(calories))
```


As we can see from the visualization the missing values among the columns calories, carbohydrate, sugar and protein have a pattern, when one has a missing value they all have a missing value. 

```{r}
rct_tbl %>% 
	mutate(missing = ifelse(is.na(calories), "Missing", "Not-Missing")) %>% 
	select(high_traffic, missing) %>% 
	nest_by(missing) %>% 
	mutate(stats = list(binom_stats(data, "High"))) %>% 
	select(-data) %>% 
	unnest(stats) %>%
	ungroup() %>% 
	ggplot(aes(missing, Proportion)) +
	geom_point(size = 2) +
	geom_hline(aes(yintercept = high_prop), linetype = 2, color = "red") +
	geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = Lower, ymax = Upper), width = 0.1) +
	scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
	expand_limits(y = c(0, 1)) +
	theme_bw() +
	labs(title = "Proportion of High Traffic with 95% Confidence Interval",
         x = "")
```

While there is some overlap between the errorbars, it seems that there is in fact a relationship between the response and missing values. When a value is missing it tends to have a higher proportion of recipes with "High" traffic. I will add a column flagging missing to the modeling process.

```{r}
rct_tbl <- rct_tbl %>% 
	mutate(missing = ifelse(is.na(calories), "Missing", "Not-Missing"))
```

### Model Development

The outcome value has one of two possible values, "High" or "Not-High". As our outcome only has two possible values we use classification, in specific binary classification, to predict whether a recipe will generate high traffic or not. 

The EDA has revealed that the category column and the flagged missing column are, obstensibly, the only predictors with a meaningful relationship with high_trafic. I will therefore be trying the following preprocessing recipes:

1. A baseline recipe with category and missing as the predictors.
2. A recipe with all the predictors but with filtered missing values.
3. A recipe with all the predictors. (This recipe will be exclusive to the comparison model, XGBOOST, which is robust against missing values)

Models like XGBOOST can essentially memorize the training set. Therefore, I'll use cross-validation, a well established method for screening many models at once, to compare the models. Cross-validation is used to ensure model evaluation statistics are not unrealistically optimistic. I'll also train using a variety of hyperparameters to give each model it's best chance.

### Baseline Model: glmnet

- The algorithm is extremely fast.
- It fits linear, logistic and multinomial, poisson and Cox regression models.
- It has an option for regularized regression, encouraging simplicity by removing predictors and/or shrinking their coefficients towards zero.
- Coefficients provide inference.

### Comparison Model: XGBOOST

- Transforming continuous variables are not required for this model.
- Robust to outliers.
- Robust to missing values.
- Works well with non-linear data.
- Works well with interaction effect between predictors.
- Often produces better accuracy than other algorithms.

```{r}
set.seed(123)
splits <- initial_split(rct_tbl, strata = missing)
folds <- vfold_cv(training(splits), strata = missing)

baseline_recipe <- training(splits) %>%

        ),
        models = list(
        	glmnet  = glmnet_spec,
            xgboost = xgb_spec
        ),
        cross = TRUE
    )  %>% 
	bind_rows(
    	as_workflow_set(xgb_rec_xgboost = xgb_wflw)
    )

grid_ctrl <-
   control_grid(
      save_pred = TRUE,
      save_workflow = TRUE
   )

grid_results <-
   rct_models %>%
   workflow_map(
      seed = 234,
      resamples = folds,
      grid = 20,
      control = grid_ctrl,
      metrics = metric_set(roc_auc, pr_auc)
   )
```

## Model Evaluation

"They want us to predict which recipes will be popular 80% of the time and minimize the chance of showing unpopular recipes."

There business is interested in two clear metrics:

- **Precision:** When the model has a precision of 0.8, it predicts a recipe will generate "High" traffic 80% of the time. Unfortunately, precision and recall are often in tension. That is, improving precision typically reduces recall and vice versa. Therefore, you must examine both precision and recall. I will do this using the area under the precision-recall curve (PR AUC).
- **False Positive Rate:** Again, the False Positive rate is in tension with recall. Lowering the classification threshold classifies more items as positive, thus increasing both False Positives and True Positives. Increasing the classification threshold classifies more items as negative, thus increasing both False Negatives and True Negatives. Therefore, I will use the  area under a receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC), to help evaluate the models.

### PR AUC

```{r}
grid_results %>% 
	autoplot(metric = "pr_auc") +
	scale_colour_manual(values = c("logistic_reg" = "steelblue", "boost_tree" = "red")) +
	theme_bw() +
	labs(title = "Estimated PR AUC")
```

### ROC AUC

```{r}
grid_results %>% 
	autoplot(metric = "roc_auc") +
	scale_colour_manual(values = c("logistic_reg" = "steelblue", "boost_tree" = "red")) +
	theme_bw() +
	labs(title = "Estimated ROC AUC")

grid_results %>% rank_results(select_best = TRUE)
```

Scoring a PR AUC of 0.881 and a ROC AUC of 0.8228, the baseline model (glmnet) using only category and missing as predictors is the best performing model. The best performing comparison model (XGBOOST) uses the same preprocessing technique and scores a PR AUC of 0.8789 and a ROC AUC of 0.8212. These models and their hyperparameters will be used moving forward.

### Test Set Results

```{r}
best_results_glmnet <- 
    grid_results %>% 
    extract_workflow_set_result("baseline_glmnet") %>% 
    select_best(metric = "roc_auc")

best_results_xgb <- 
	grid_results %>% 
    extract_workflow_set_result("baseline_xgboost") %>% 
    select_best(metric = "roc_auc")

set.seed(345)
baseline_model_test_results <- 
    grid_results %>% 
    extract_workflow("baseline_glmnet") %>% 
    finalize_workflow(best_results_glmnet) %>% 
    last_fit(split = splits, metrics = metric_set(precision, specificity, pr_auc, roc_auc))

set.seed(456)
comparison_model_test_results <- 
    grid_results %>% 
    extract_workflow("baseline_xgboost") %>% 
    finalize_workflow(best_results_xgb) %>% 
    last_fit(split = splits, metrics = metric_set(precision, specificity, pr_auc, roc_auc))

baseline_model_test_results %>% 
	collect_metrics() %>% 
	add_column(model = "glmnet") %>% 
	bind_rows(
        comparison_model_test_results %>% 
        	collect_metrics() %>% 
        	add_column(model = "xgboost")
    ) %>% 
	select(model, .metric, .estimate) %>% 
	mutate(.estimate = ifelse(.metric == "specificity", 1-.estimate, .estimate),
           .metric = ifelse(.metric == "specificity", "false_positive_rate", .metric)) %>% 
    knitr::kable()
```

At the default classification threshold, both models scored a Precision of 0.8042 on never before seen data, so both models meet the request to correctly predict high traffic recipes 80% of the time.

The business is also interested in minimizing the chance of showing unpopular recipes. At the default classification threshold, both models scored a False Positive Rate of 29.17% on never before seen data. This means that from the 96 total "Not-High" in the test set, 28 were classified as "High". 

glmnet remains the best performing model on never before seen data with a PR AUC of 0.9116, compared to xgboost's 0.8993, and an ROC AUC of 0.8611, compared to xgboost's 0.8565.

I will include a precision vs recall plot and a ROC curve plot incase the reader wishes to investigate the adjustment of the classification threshold on precision, recall (true positive rate) and 1 - specificity (false positive rate).

```{r}

# 	count(high_traffic)

### Explaining Gain/Lift

In the table above, in the first 10 observations we had a 100% accuracy (10 out of 10 recipes) on how well this classifier is performing. 

#### Gain

Without the model, we'd expect the global "High" traffic rate which was 63.73%, $947 \times 0.6373 = 603.52$. If we expect 604 recipes to be "High" traffic, we just gained 10 out of those 603.52 (or 1.66%) in just the first 10 observations.

#### Lift

If we expected $10 \times 0.6373 = 6.373$ recipes to be "High" in the first 10 observations we beat the expectation by $10 / 6.373 = 1.57$ times.

#### Executive Communication

Gain & Lift are results-based metrics. Gain & Lift can help communicate modeling results in terms the business understands and cares about. This model can predict above what we couldn't predict normally without any given model.

### GLMNET Gain

         y     = "Gain", color = "")
```

The gain across glmnet and xgboost is almost identical. 

The way to read this chart. If we took 25% of our recipes (Cumulative Data Fraction) without our model we would expect to get a gain of 25% of the 604 "High" traffic recipes (baseline). With our model sorted by the highest probability of "High" traffic, we would expect to gain close to 40% of the 604 "High" traffic recipes in the first 25% of our recipes.

### GLMNET Lift

```{r}
glmnet_pred_tbl %>% 
	lift_curve(high_traffic, .pred_High)  %>%  
	mutate(Baseline = 1) %>% 
	rename(Lift = .lift) %>% 
	filter(!is.nan(Lift)) %>% 
	pivot_longer(c(Lift, Baseline)) %>% 
	ggplot(aes(.percent_tested, value, color = name)) +
	geom_line(linewidth = 1.5) +
	scale_color_manual(values = c("Lift" = "steelblue", "Baseline" = "red")) +
	theme_bw() +
	labs(title = "Lift Chart",
         x     = "Cumulative Data Fraction",
         y     = "Lift", color = "")
```


### XGBOOST Lift

```{r}
xgb_pred_tbl %>% 
	lift_curve(high_traffic, .pred_High)  %>%  
	mutate(Baseline = 1) %>% 
	rename(Lift = .lift) %>% 
	filter(!is.nan(Lift)) %>% 
	pivot_longer(c(Lift, Baseline)) %>% 
	ggplot(aes(.percent_tested, value, color = name)) +
	geom_line(linewidth = 1.5) +
	scale_color_manual(values = c("Lift" = "steelblue", "Baseline" = "red")) +
	theme_bw() +
	labs(title = "XGBOOST Lift Chart",
         x     = "Cumulative Data Fraction",
         y     = "Lift", color = "")
```

Again, the lift across glmnet and xgboost is almost identical.

The way to read this chart. With our model sorted by the highest probability of "High" traffic, the first 25% of our recipes (Cumulative Data Fraction) with our model we would expect to get a lift of close to 1.6X of what we would expect without our model (i.e. using random chance).

## Final Summary

### Relationships Between Response & Predictors

I discovered that the most important predictor is the recipe category in predicting "High" traffic.. Both the EDA and modeling process validate this claim. There seems to be a mild relationship between the missing values in the data and "High" traffic recipes.

### Evaluating Models

"They want us to predict which recipes will be popular 80% of the time and minimize the chance of showing unpopular recipes."

- Both models can achieve a precision of 80.42% on never before seen data.
- On never before seen data, 28 out of 96 (or 29.17%) "Not-High" traffic recipes were incorrectly classified as "High" traffic recipes.
- The baseline model (glmnet) was the best performing model in terms of PR AUC and ROC AUC.

In order to improve accuracy we can explore more features. The "Example Recipe" from the instructions document included features such as:

- **Title:**: "Tomato Soup"
- **Time to make:** "2 hours"
- **Cost per serving**
- **ingredients:** "Tomatoes, Onion, Carrot, Vegetable Stock" 
- **Method:** "1.	Cut the tomatoes into quartersâ€¦"

These may add predictive value to our model.

### Connecting Model to Business Value

I used Gain & Lift charts to connect the best performing model to business goals. When sorted by highest probability of "High" traffic recipes, the first 25% of our recipes is estimated to gain close to 40% of the "High" traffic recipes, a 15% improvement over the baseline of 25%, which translates to close to a 1.6X Lift.

### Recommendations

I recommend:
- Iteratively improving the model over time with:
  - additional features
  - additional observations
  - screening more models and preprocessing techniques
- Utilize the current model as it's shown to meet targets and provide business value, time to put the model into production.
